## change-pros:
Change-pros focuses on how eliza addresses the user and itself. What pronounds does it use and how does it approach the user using different ones in different ways. The main ways I approached pronounds with eliza are:

#### Swap my and your
This one is simple, since your figuring our possessive pronouns, and is necessary when apporaching any common language

#### Swap me and you || Swap am and are
These two are quite different on the basis that theres no direct comparison for the 2nd person pronoun. Kept these two together on that basesis

#### Swap mine and yours
Same idea as my and your, just pluralized

#### Swap we and you
These ones are quite different on the idea that eliza needs to be able to swap between  plural definitions of i and you and mine and yours for special cases where eliza needs to talk to the person as if it's part of that persons'a gorup
